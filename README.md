# 🔍 Solar Panel Defect Detection using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect various types of defects in solar panels using **ResNet50** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The app provides predictions and probabilities for each defect type through a user-friendly **Streamlit** web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload solar panel images and get predictions in real time.
- Detects multiple types of defects:
  - **Cracks**
  - **Physical Damage**
  - **Discoloration**
  - **Snow-Covered Panels**
  - **Dust or Bird Droppings**
- Interactive UI with progress bars showing prediction confidence.
- Built with `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `OpenCV`, and `Streamlit`.
